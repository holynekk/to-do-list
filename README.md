# to-do-list

# Build With

- Javascript
- HTML/CSS3
- Webpack
- npm


This project is a classic to-do-list app. It allows you to add different folders/projects and each one of them has sub tasks with title, description, date and priority info. All the information is stored locally in your browser. Namely, at the beginning, app start a local container in your browser that holds all your projects, and save it there.

Currently its not responsive, so reviewing it on 1080p screen is the best for now.

# Learning Outcomes

This project was kind a tough one for me, because I didn't know where to start at the beginning. Then I just try to build its skeleton with HTML/CSS. After its done, I created each module file one by one. I have used webpack and npm for this project. Actually, because those things are new to me, I couldn't use them as much as I wanted, but at least learned its basics.
